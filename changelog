v.0.4.9: Ui with good progress. See changelog.
    The management ui works so far for all but abos.
    This table needs the overhaul based on the json
    input changes.
    Also need to updaten and add new unittests
    to all functions (test_abo to test_products;
    the getter changed everywhere).
    Other to-dos are a full interface check.
    Some integration tests.
    Maybe we add also a bulk adder.
    We have to add a backup function for the db too.
    If everything goes well, I am going to add a basic
    reporting tool too.

v.0.4.8: Tables. See changelog.
    Still working on the data fetching from the server.
    The basic tables are implemented. Adding & updating
    possible.
    There is still the option to bulk import missing
    (strg+c -> strg+v).
    The products & abos need also additional dropdown
    menus, so the user can select the product by name
    in the ui.

    Also the frontend (which will be basically just a 
    editable table).
